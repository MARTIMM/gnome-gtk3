# Examples

Here you can select several examples to study the Perl6 code and compare the screenshots when you have copied and run the example code. The idea is to show complete programs in contrast to the tutorial where mostly only snippets are shown except for the simplest.

## A pallet of examples in a list
* **Window**; An empty window with a title
* **Grid**; Filling a grid with labels
* **HW**; *Hello World* with buttons and actions
* **Text**; Text reading and writing
* **LB**; *ListBox* manipulations


* **Glade**; Using glade designs
* **Style**;
* **Theme**;
* **Test**;
