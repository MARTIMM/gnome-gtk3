Gnome::Gdk3::Drag
=================

Functions for controlling drag and drop handling

Description
===========

These functions provide a low level interface for drag and drop. The X backend of GDK supports both the Xdnd and Motif drag and drop protocols transparently, the Win32 backend supports the WM-DROPFILES protocol.

GTK+ provides a higher level abstraction based on top of these functions, and so they are not normally needed in GTK+ applications. See the [Drag and Drop][gtk3-Drag-and-Drop] section of * the GTK+ documentation for more information.

  * GDK-ACTION-DEFAULT: Means nothing, and should not be used.

  * GDK-ACTION-COPY: Copy the data.

  * GDK-ACTION-MOVE: Move the data, i.e. first copy it, then delete it from the source using the DELETE target of the X selection protocol.

  * GDK-ACTION-LINK: Add a link to the data. Note that this is only useful if source and destination agree on what it means.

  * GDK-ACTION-PRIVATE: Special action which tells the source that the destination will do something that the source doesnâ€™t understand.

  * GDK-ACTION-ASK: Ask the user what to do with the data.

enum GdkDragCancelReason

  * GDK-DRAG-CANCEL-ERROR: Unspecified error.
