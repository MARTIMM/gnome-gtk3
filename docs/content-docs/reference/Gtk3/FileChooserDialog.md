Creates a new filechooser dialog widget. It returns a native object which must be stored in another object. Better, shorter and easier is to use `.new(....)`. See info below.

new
---

    multi method new ( Str :$title! )

Create a filechooser dialog with given title. There will be only two buttons `:bt1text` and `:bt2text`. These are by default `Cancel` and `Accept`. There response types are given by `:bt1response` and `:bt2response`. Defaults for these are `GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL` and `GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT` respectively.

The filechooser action is set with `:action` which has `GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN` as its default.

The parent window is set by `:window` and is by default `Any`.

The values are defined in `Gnome::Gtk3::Dialog` and `GtkFileChooser`.
