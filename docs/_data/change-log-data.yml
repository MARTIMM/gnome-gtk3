  - 2019-11-23 0.19.3:

  - 2019-11-06 0.19.2:
    - Add modules ListStore, TreeView, TreeIter, TreePath, TreeViewColumn, TreeModel in Gnome::Gtk3

  - 2019-10-27 0.19.1:
    - Rewrite of classes to handle interface roles differently. This caused some changes in the interface modules, the classes which use the interfaces and the Interface module from Gnome::GObject was removed.

  - 2019-10-21 0.19.0:
    - New classes added in Gnome::Gtk3; Buildable.

  - 2019-08-08 0.18.5:
    - The handler arguments list is changed when register-signal() from Gnome::GObject::Object is used. Some positional arguments, which were named arguments before, are oblegatory as well as their types. Most of them are unchanged because they did not receive extra data. For example the 'clicked' signal for a Button. Others like event processing are changed. E.g. 'button-press-event' on a window was returned on the :$event named argument. Now this has become the first positional argument with a type 'GdkEvent'.

    - One can connect also directly using g_signal_connect_object() from Gnome::GObject::Signal. Also here, the handler must provide all arguments and types and some more.

    - Added a method in Gnome::GObject::Object for interface using modules to query the interface modules for native subs. For example, the module Gnome::Gtk3::Button implements Gnome::Gtk3::Buildable. This means that subs defined there can be used by the Button module. Not all interfaces are implemented however, but the unimplemeted modules are silently ignored until a method is not found which will throw an exception.

    - The new() method in module Label of Gnome::Gtk3 is modified. The named attribute :$label is renamed into :$text. :$label is deprecated.
