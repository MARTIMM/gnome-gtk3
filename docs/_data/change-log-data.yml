notes:
  # remove some deprecated methods in Builder at version 0.22.0
  - 2019-08-08 0.18.5:
    - The handler arguments list is changed when register-signal() from Gnome::GObject::Object is used. Some positional arguments, which were named arguments before, are oblegatory as well as their types. Most of them are unchanged because they did not receive extra data. For example the 'clicked' signal for a Button. Others like event processing are changed. E.g. 'button-press-event' on a window was returned on the :$event named argument. Now this has become the first positional argument with a type 'GdkEvent'.

    - One can connect also directly using g_signal_connect_object() from Gnome::GObject::Signal. Also here, the handler must provide all arguments and types and some more.

    - Added a method in Gnome::GObject::Object for interface using modules to query the interface modules for native subs. For example, the module Gnome::Gtk3::Button implements Gnome::Gtk3::Buildable. This means that subs defined there can be used by the Button module.
