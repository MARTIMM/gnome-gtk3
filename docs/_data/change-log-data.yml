- 2020-11-24 0.34.1:
  - Doc changes

  - Add module **Gnome::Gtk3::Tooltip**.
  - Bugfixes in the TreeView set of modules.
  - Also added methods and docs added with tests.
  - Bugfixes in **Gnome::GObject::Object** and **Gnome::GObject::Signal**. The return value of a signal handler set using `.register-signal()` was processed wrong and was always thrown away.

- 2020-11-15 0.33.0:
  - Add module **Gnome::Gtk3::SpinButton**.
  - Some bugs removed from **Gnome::Gtk3::Adjustment**. Also completed testing and documenting.

  - Dropped .gtk_widget_init_template(), .gtk_widget_get_template_child() and several other template methods
  - Modified the structure types of `GdkEvent*` into `N-GdkEvent*` in Gnome::Gdk3::Events. The older types are deprecated and are removed in version 0.20.0 of the Gnome::Gdk3 package.

- 2020-07-09 0.29.0:
  - Changes in Gnome::Gtk3::Widget;
  - Add .destroy(), .show(), .hide(), .draw()  methods to minimize function name size. E.g. draw() calls gtk_widget_draw() which could only be shortened to widget_draw().

  - Dropped .gtk_widget_queue_resize(), .gtk_widget_queue_resize_no_redraw() .gtk_widget_queue_allocate(), .gtk_widget_event(), .gtk_widget_send_focus_change(), .gtk_widget_set_has_window(), .gtk_widget_set_realized(), .gtk_widget_set_mapped(), .gtk_widget_set_parent(), .gtk_widget_set_parent_window(), .gtk_widget_set_child_visible(), .gtk_widget_get_child_visible(), .gtk_widget_set_allocation(), .gtk_widget_set_clip()

- 2020-06-09 0.28.6:
  - Add Gnome::Gtk3::DrawingArea. First experiments to use Cairo.
  - It is a pitty that I cannot use the Raku Cairo package of Timo because I cannot fit it into the calls of the existing Gnome packages. An entire new project is created called Gnome::Cairo. Need to mention that Cairo is not a Gnome product but named here this way because the way to access the classes and methods are about the same as with the other Gnome projects of mine.
  - Added gtk_widget_draw() to Gnome::Gtk3::Widget and tested the draw signal.
  - Added gdk_window_create_similar_surface() and gdk_window_create_similar_image_surface() to Gnome::Gdk3::Window.
  - Modified convert-to-natives() in Gnome::N::TopLevelClassSupport that it checks for destination argument type. When it detects num32 or num64 all source values are coerced using .Num(). This means that next examples are now valid for Num arguments; 10, 1/2, 0e2, '2.3' (these are Int, Rat, Num and Str resp).

- 2020-05-21 0.28.5:
  - 'Changes for issue #11'

- 2020-05-15 0.28.4:

- 2020-04-28 0.28.2:
  - Some improvements to start-thread() in Gnome::GObject::Object.
  - Method register-signal() now returns an integer instead of a boolean. This integer is a handler-id which can be used to disconnect the signal with g_signal_handler_disconnect(). When handler is 0, the registration failed. The other method to connect a signal is g_signal_connect_object() which will also return a handler id.
  - Added .new(:icon-name) to Gnome::Gtk3::Button and made the class inheritable.
  - Added a Uml diagram to AboutDialog and Button.

- 2020-04-17 0.28.1:
  - Made Gnome::Gtk3::CheckButton, Gnome::Gtk3::Scale, Gnome::Gtk3::Image, Gnome::Gtk3::Entry and Gnome::Gtk3::RadioButton inheritable.
  - Added a few multi to submethod BUILD to create an image from pixbufs and resources.

- 2020-04-17 0.28.0:
  - Added modules Gnome::Gtk3::TreeSelection, Gnome::Gtk3::Popover, Gnome::Gtk3::PopoverMenu and Gnome::Gtk3::Separator.
  - Add 'CATCH { default { .message.note; .backtrace.concise.note } }' to callback code in modules Gnome::GObject::Object and Container, ListBox, TextTagTable and TreeModel in Gnome::Gtk3. This prevents the situation that a moarvm panic occurs without a stackdump to follow. This improves the search for errors and typos very much.
  - Enabled gtk_tree_view_expand_to_path(), gtk_tree_view_row_expanded(), gtk_tree_view_expand_row() and gtk_tree_view_collapse_row() in Gnome::Gtk3::TreeView.
  - $str.chars() changed into $str.encode.bytes in a few places. This is the correct lenght, thanks Alain Barbason.

  - Enabled method gtk_tree_view_get_cell_area(), gtk_tree_view_get_selection() in Gnome::Gtk3::TreeView
  - Enabled method gtk_menu_popup-at-widget(), gtk_menu_popup_at_rect() in Gnome::Gtk3::Menu.
  - Cleanup and some modifications in Gnome::Gtk3::TreeStore.
  - Added `gdk_pixbuf_get_type()` in Gnome::Gdk3::Pixbuf to support a missing type GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF. This cannot be encoded because it is not a fundamental type like G_TYPE_INT.
  - Made classes ApplicationWindow, Application, Dialog, AboutDialog, MessageDialog, Grid, RecentChooserMenu, Notebook, TreeView and TreeStore in Gnome::Gtk3 inheritable.

- 2020-04-06 0.27.4:
  - Enabled method gtk_label_set_markup() in Gnome::Gtk3::Label.
  - Enabled method gtk_builder_connect_signals_full in Gnome::Gtk3::Builder.

- 2020-04-06 0.27.3:
  - Enabled method g_type_name_from_instance() to Gnom::GObject::Type.

- 2020-04-05 0.27.2:

- 2020-03-23 0.26.3:
  - Provide gtk_css_provider_to_string() method to the CssProvider class.

- 2020-03-15 0.26.2:
  - Developed a top level support class Gnome::N::TopLevelClassSupport to be used by all Gnome classes living at the top of the foodchain. Example classes which will use this class are Gnome::GObject::Object, Gnome::Glib::Error, etc. These changes should be invisible to the user.

- 2020-03-09 0.26.1:

  - New module TreeStore. Needs more tests

- 2019-11-23 0.19.3:

  - Modified _fallback routines to change order of tests

- 2019-11-06 0.19.2:
  - Add modules ListStore, TreeView, TreeIter, TreePath, TreeViewColumn, TreeModel in Gnome::Gtk3

- 2019-10-27 0.19.1:

- 2019-10-21 0.19.0:
  - New classes added in Gnome::Gtk3; Buildable.

- 2019-08-08 0.18.5:
  - The handler arguments list is changed when register-signal() from Gnome::GObject::Object is used. Some positional arguments, which were named arguments before, are oblegatory as well as their types. Most of them are unchanged because they did not receive extra data. For example the 'clicked' signal for a Button. Others like event processing are changed. E.g. 'button-press-event' on a window was returned on the :$event named argument. Now this has become the first positional argument with a type 'GdkEvent'.

  - One can connect also directly using g_signal_connect_object() from Gnome::GObject::Signal. Also here, the handler must provide all arguments and types and some more.

  - Added a method in Gnome::GObject::Object for interface using modules to query the interface modules for native subs. For example, the module Gnome::Gtk3::Button implements Gnome::Gtk3::Buildable. This means that subs defined there can be used by the Button module. Not all interfaces are implemented however, but the unimplemeted modules are silently ignored until a method is not found which will throw an exception.

  - The new() method in module Label of Gnome::Gtk3 is modified. The named attribute :$label is renamed into :$text. :$label is deprecated.
