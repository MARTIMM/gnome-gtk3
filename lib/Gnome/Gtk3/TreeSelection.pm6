=head1 Gnome::Gtk3::TreeSelection

The selection object for B<Gnome::Gtk3::TreeView>

=comment ![](images/X.png)

=head1 Description

The B<Gnome::Gtk3::TreeSelection> object is a helper object to manage the selection for a B<Gnome::Gtk3::TreeView> widget. The B<Gnome::Gtk3::TreeSelection> object is automatically created when a new B<Gnome::Gtk3::TreeView> widget is created, and cannot exist independently of this widget. The primary reason the B<Gnome::Gtk3::TreeSelection> objects exists is for cleanliness of code and API. That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions could not be methods on the B<Gnome::Gtk3::TreeView> widget instead of a separate function.

The B<Gnome::Gtk3::TreeSelection> object is gotten from a B<Gnome::Gtk3::TreeView> by calling C<gtk_tree_view_get_selection()>.  It can be manipulated to check the selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect individual rows.  Selection is done completely view side.  As a result, multiple views of the same model can have completely different selections. Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents first.

One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of a view is that the  I<changed> signal is mostly a hint. That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is selected. Additionally, it may on occasion emit a  I<changed> signal when nothing has happened (mostly as a result of programmers calling select_row on an already selected row).

=head2 Inheriting this class

Inheriting is done in a special way in that it needs a call from new() to get the native object created by the class you are inheriting from.

  use Gnome::Gtk3::TreeSelection;

  unit class MyGuiClass;
  also is Gnome::Gtk3::TreeSelection;

  submethod new ( |c ) {
    # let the Gnome::Gtk3::TreeSelection class process the options

=head1 Signals

There are two ways to connect to a signal. The first option you have is to use C<register-signal()> from B<Gnome::GObject::Object>. The second option is to use C<g_signal_connect_object()> directly from B<Gnome::GObject::Signal>.

=head2 First method

The positional arguments of the signal handler are all obligatory as well as their types. The named attributes C<:$widget> and user data are optional.

  # handler method
  method mouse-event ( N-GdkEvent $event, :$widget ) { ... }

  # connect a signal on window object
  my Gnome::Gtk3::Window $w .= new( ... );
  $w.register-signal( self, 'mouse-event', 'button-press-event');

=head2 Second method

  my Gnome::Gtk3::Window $w .= new( ... );
  my Callable $handler = sub (
    N-GObject $native, N-GdkEvent $event, OpaquePointer $data
  ) {
    ...
  }

  $w.connect-object( 'button-press-event', $handler);

Also here, the types of positional arguments in the signal handler are important. This is because both methods C<register-signal()> and C<g_signal_connect_object()> are using the signatures of the handler routines to setup the native call interface.

=head2 Supported signals


=comment #TS:0:changed:
=head3 changed

Emitted whenever the selection has (possibly) changed. Please note that
this signal is mostly a hint.  It may only be emitted once when a range
of rows are selected, and it may occasionally be emitted when nothing
has happened.

  method handler (
    Int :$_handler_id,
    Gnome::GObject::Object :_widget($treeselection),
    *%user-options
  );

=item $treeselection; the object which received the signal.
